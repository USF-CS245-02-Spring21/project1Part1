# Project 1 Part 1: Sorting

For part 1 of project1, you need to implement the following sorting methods:
-	Insertion sort
-	Cocktail Shaker sort 
-	A variation of Quick Sort
-	External sort

You also need to implement an efficient, linear time, algorithm that takes two sorted arrays and returns an array of the elements that occur in both arrays.
Please see the pdf description of the project on Canvas for more details.
